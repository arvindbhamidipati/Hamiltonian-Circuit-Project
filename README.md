Welcome to Hamiltonian Circuit Problem - Europe Edition.

Though this project, the goal is to create a simulated flight pattern through listed European cities.
The flight pattern however must represent a Hamiltonian circuit.

Background

The Hamiltonian Circuit or path, is a graph theory concept
	Undirected or directed graph that visits each vertex exactly once
	Circuit - a path of edges and vertices wherein a vertex is reachable from itself
	Discovered by William Rowan Hamilton who invented the icosian game - Hamiltonâ€™s puzzle.
